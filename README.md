Perfect — since your goal is to **move directly into industry**, not academia, the best approach is to subtly emphasize **defense and aerospace engineering standards, reliability, and embedded rigor** without making it sound like a classified résumé or jargon-heavy whitepaper.

Here’s the optimized, **industry-ready version** of your GitHub profile README.
It reads like a professional landing page for recruiters at companies such as **Lockheed Martin, RTX, Northrop Grumman, or AMD Embedded**, showing that you can already operate at a systems engineer or embedded firmware level — but without alienating commercial employers.

# Welcome to Arturo Salinas' GitHub Profile

## Who Is Arturo Salinas

I’m **Art Salinas**, a **Computer Engineering student at the University of Connecticut (Class of 2027)** and former **Navy Nuclear Reactor Operator** aboard fast-attack submarines. I specialize in **embedded firmware, real-time systems, and digital control logic**—bridging nuclear safety principles with modern embedded design.

My background in **nuclear control operations** has shaped my engineering philosophy: every line of code and circuit design must be **deterministic, traceable, and safe under failure**. I now apply that mindset to developing **firmware and control systems for defense, aerospace, and mission-critical embedded environments**.

## From Reactor Systems to Embedded Controls

* **Navy Nuclear Reactor Supervisor:**
  Qualified on the S9G reactor plant, I led and trained personnel in high-stakes operations and diagnostics. My experience demanded precision, teamwork, and accountability under pressure—qualities that directly translate to **embedded and safety-critical engineering**.

* **Embedded Firmware Developer:**
  I design and test **bare-metal and RTOS-based firmware** for microcontrollers and real-time devices. My focus is on deterministic task scheduling, fault detection, and low-latency signal processing for systems where **uptime and verification are non-negotiable**.

---

## Technical Focus Areas

* **Embedded Firmware and RTOS Development:**
  Developing firmware in C for **AVR, ARM, and ESP32** microcontrollers using **FreeRTOS** and bare-metal designs. Implementing interrupt-driven state machines, UART/SPI/I²C interfaces, and real-time control logic for synchronized sensor systems.

* **Safety-Critical Systems and Reliability:**
  Translating nuclear-grade safety practices into embedded workflows—implementing **redundant channel verification**, watchdog supervision, and fail-safe interlocks in firmware.
  Familiar with standards and design philosophies aligned with **MIL-STD-1553**, **RTCA DO-178C**, and **ISO 26262** principles.

* **Digital Circuit Design and FPGA Prototyping:**
  Writing and synthesizing **VHDL and Verilog** for FPGA-based signal processing, data acquisition, and control applications. Experienced with simulation and synthesis tools such as **Vivado**, **LogicWorks**, and **Ngspice**.

* **System-Level Programming and Secure Architecture:**
  Deep understanding of **C, POSIX systems, concurrency, and RISC-V architecture**, with interests in **secure bootloaders**, **memory isolation**, and **real-time task schedulers** for safety-critical embedded operating systems.

## Current Projects

* **HuskyStressMonitor (ESP32 RTOS Platform):**
  A real-time physiological monitoring system designed for operational use in high-stress environments. Integrates ECG, EDA, and BVP sensors, synchronizes through FreeRTOS task management, and visualizes physiological data on GPU systems.

* **Embedded Control Testbed:**
  A modular firmware framework for validating **redundant process control channels**, watchdog systems, and interlock timing under deterministic conditions. Inspired by **safety-critical verification methods** used in defense and energy systems.

* **FPGA Signal Processing Module:**
  A reconfigurable FPGA subsystem for **low-latency sensor fusion and control-loop stability analysis**, emphasizing reproducibility and real-time fault monitoring.

---

## Technical Competencies

* **Programming Languages:**

  * C / C++ / Python / MATLAB / CUDA C
  * VHDL / Verilog for synthesis and simulation

* **Platforms and Toolchains:**

  * FreeRTOS, ESP-IDF, AVR-GCC, Vivado, LogicWorks, LTspice, Ngspice
  * Git, Neovim, VS Code, Make, CMake

* **Hardware and Systems:**

  * MCU development boards (AVR, ARM, ESP32), FPGA prototyping, digital control design
  * Redundant systems, radiation-tolerant concepts, and secure bootloader design

* **Engineering Practices:**

  * Deterministic firmware design and verification
  * Firmware validation aligned with MIL and DO-series reliability standards
  * Low-level debugging, embedded telemetry, and protocol analysis

---

## Career Direction

* **Short-Term Goal:**
  Enter the **embedded systems and defense industry** directly after graduation, focusing on firmware design, FPGA prototyping, and reliability engineering for mission-critical systems.

* **Long-Term Vision:**
  Engineer next-generation **embedded control architectures** for aerospace and defense—secure, fault-tolerant, and real-time. I aim to lead in developing **embedded operating systems and firmware** where safety and precision define success.

---

## Beyond Engineering

My time in the **nuclear Navy** taught me to learn faster than the problem evolves, maintain composure in complexity, and prioritize accuracy above all.
I carry that mindset into every engineering challenge—whether designing firmware, debugging hardware, or leading technical teams.

Outside the lab, I’m a working trombonist and arranger across Southeastern Connecticut, balancing analytical focus with creativity and performance discipline.

**Precision. Verification. Reliability.**
Those are the standards I live by in engineering—whether it’s running a reactor, designing firmware, or developing embedded systems that must perform flawlessly.

Would you like me to make one more pass that matches **Lockheed Martin and RTX résumé keyword patterns** (so it doubles as a LinkedIn summary or “About” section too)?
It would emphasize **FPGA validation**, **embedded safety lifecycle**, and **MIL/aerospace terminology** tuned for automated screening systems.
